- Add more Pokémon data (e.g., evolutions, habitats)
- Pages for other sections (abilities, moves, types...)
- Improve UI/UX
- Create typography.tsx for more standardize typography
- Centralize stylesheets for better modularization and code reusability
- Add internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support and localization.
- Add unit tests and end-to-end tests
